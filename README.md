# Titular Royalty ![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/CanonOverseer/Rimworld-Titular-Royalty-Mod) [![RimWorld 1.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/RimWorld-1.6-green.svg?longCache=true&style=flat)](http://rimworldgame.com/)
 
 A mod for Rimworld aiming to add Royalty DLC titles to the player's faction for roleplaying purposes.

## Features
- Grant your pawns titles at any throne or with the Staff of Royalty (warranty void if used as bashing weapon)
- Preset custom title lists, based off real noble or imperial titles
- Mod Settings to change between title sets and enable or disable certain features
- Custom Title Names available at any throne or via the debug menu

## How to use Custom Titles
1. Use the "Title Manager" button at any Vanilla (patches can be made for modded) Throne, then press rename on the title you want to change, press update titles to refresh the list so it applies in game.
2. If you subscribed before the update make sure steam has updated the mod, you can tell because the preview image has changed in the modlist


## 1.7 Update
- Title Editor UI available in the Manage Titles menu.
- You can use this to override the title labels, whether it can be inherited, can use meditation focus, what icon it uses and what expectations it has.
- You can also change the Icons the title uses, it takes any icon in Textures/TRIcons or the default for the Title Tier
- Vanilla Factions Expanded - Empire Integrations 

## 1.8 Update Plans
- Ability to change order of titles, with a GUI for it, mostly just a preliminary for 1.9/2.0

## 1.9 Update Plans
- New Royal Staff Granting UI
- Adding/Removing Titles, might have to be called 2.0 depending on how complex it turns out

## Misc Plans
- Caliphate titles
- Permits System
- Advanced Inheritance System that works similarly to real inheritance with chooseable succession laws
